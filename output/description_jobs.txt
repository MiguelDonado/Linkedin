 About the job Description Amazon Web Services is seeking an Associate Solutions Architect to support our US Government customers in the Northern Virginia / DC Metro area. (Relocation assistance is available.) AWS Solutions Architects in many ways act as a “keystone”—bringing together several distinct groups within AWS that support the Intelligence Community. This is a high-visibility role where you collaborate with and influence external stakeholders (our government customers) and internal AWS teams like Sales and Platform Engineering. As a Solutions Architect on the National Security team, you will serve as a trusted technical advisor to your customers over the long haul—you are the “face of Amazon” to that customer, and they will consult you regarding a broad variety of technical challenges that are complex and mission-critical. You can build sample solutions, “think big,” and provide architecture designs and cloud enablement strategy that suit your customer’s business and technical needs. National Security Solutions Architects are regarded as technical “thought leaders” within the Intelligence Community who evangelize emerging technologies on a conceptual level and on a practical, architectural level. Our SAs have played a critical role in the widespread adoption and advancement of cloud computing capabilities within the Intelligence Community. SAs think outside of the box to deliver results to our customers and provide solutions that are cost-effective, time-saving, and secure. As a National Security SA, you’ll solve problems at both the business and technical levels.

 About the job About The Team The Agent Infrastructure team at OpenAI is responsible for building systems that enable training and deployment of highly useful AI agents, both internally and for the world. We work hand-in-hand with researchers to design and scale the environment in which agentic models are trained – providing a workspace for AI models to execute code, debug issues, and develop software just as human SWEs do. Our training environment for agentic models operates at an extremely high scale and has the flexibility to emulate any environment in which an agent might work. At the same time, our team builds and maintains OpenAI’s core platform for the deployment and execution of agents in production. Our systems power products such as Codex, Operator, tool use in ChatGPT, and future agentic products. Some of the most challenging technical problems in scaling the capabilities and utility of agents and agentic models lie in the infrastructure layer – and our team is focused on building the research and production systems that enable OpenAI to train the most capable models in the world, and maximize the utility of our agentic products for users around the world. About The Role As a Software Engineer on the Agent Infrastructure team, you will have the opportunity to work closely with both research and product at OpenAI - building and scaling systems to train highly capable agentic models, and building the platform and integrations to launch new agents to hundreds of millions of users worldwide. Your work will consist of both building new capabilities - standing up the infrastructure and integrations needed to train more complex agentic models - and rapidly scaling these new capabilities to some of the largest compute clusters in the world. At the same time, you’ll be instrumental to the launch of agentic products at OpenAI - building, maintaining, and scaling the production platform on which all agents run. We’re looking for people with deep experience building AI infrastructure and who are used to working closely with researchers to build high-performance systems at massive scale for novel use cases. This role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees. We will also consider candidates based in New York City, NY on a case-by-case basis. In This Role, You Will Push massive compute clusters to their limits. You will be a core contributor to a novel container orchestration platform built in-house by our team to scale far beyond what’s possible with systems like Kubernetes. Develop and maintain FastAPI and gRPC APIs that serve as the interface for our agentic infrastructure used both in training and production. Use Terraform to stand up and evolve complex infrastructure for both research and production. Collaborate with research teams to stand up and optimize systems for novel AI training runs and experimental applications. You Might Thrive In This Role If You Have deep experience working on large-scale machine learning infrastructure. You know how to reason about training at scale, identifying bottlenecks and engineering solutions to optimize system performance in training environments. Know how to build new things from 0-1 quickly, and then scale them 1,000,000x. Have a keen eye for performance and optimization. You know how to squeeze the most performance out of complex, globally-distributed systems. Know your way around cloud platforms and work with infrastructure-as-code tech like Terraform. Are driven by solving complex, ambiguous problems at the intersection of infrastructure scalability, virtualization efficiency, and agentic capabilities. Have deep technical expertise in virtualization and containerization technologies (e.g. Kata, Firecracker, gVisor, Sysbox) and are passionate about optimizing runtime performance.

Our security team supports the unwritten fourth tenet of Slack’s mission: make people’s working lives more secure. We’re serious about protecting our infrastructure, operations, and most importantly, our customers’ data. We take a systemic approach to security and strive to provide a low friction, high-impact security model across everything we do. Slack Security Engineering is hiring a curious Senior Staff level blue team software engineer to help to drive our threat detection program and to collaborate on our development efforts. An interest in development, operations, curiosity, and a deep desire to learn are key to a successful member of the team. You will work directly on the Slack Security Engineering team with a focus on threat detection, logging, and remediation. We know that no system is perfect, but we aim to provide a record of all actions taken in our environment to address any unknowns. We’d like you to have experience in some element of Data Science / ML work - the likely result here is that you start with some simple ML models for anomaly detection, and go from there. Our eventual goal is to use LLMs to advance our alerting capabilities and even train classification/clustering models specifically on our data to generate sophisticated alerts and build a feedback loop that learns on its own. The ideal candidate is passionate about finding IOCs and suggesting new features and methods of detection to the broader team of software developers. If you can imagine it, we can write the detection with you. Do you have experience with APT tradecraft and threat intel? Please come knock on our door. Many of the current members of this dozen-person team are multidisciplinary engineers; they do SecDevOps sorts of things, they write Go, they write Python, and they scale Elasticsearch to some very interesting and precarious new heights. We’re cautious AI adopters, but we are finding benefit from actively using modern AI tooling like Cursor to accelerate our efforts. This posting is to grow our US-based, widely distributed SecOps contingent which works closely with our additional Melbourne &amp; Auckland team. We’re eager to communicate and collaborate often (over Slack, of course!), and get to see each other’s faces in very regular Zoom coworking times. You’ll join the rest of the team in our on-call rotation, and we also strongly look for you to grow your engineering participation at Slack more broadly! Slack has a positive, diverse, and supportive culture—we look for people who are curious, inventive, and work to be a little better every single day. In our work together we aim to be smart, humble, hardworking, and above all, collaborative. If this sounds like a good fit for you, why not say “hello?” What you will be doing Identify and develop new features and a roadmap to augment existing tools to protect Slack’s production infrastructure and to help make our business lives simpler, more pleasant, more productive, and more secure Detect threats and help Slack be more secure Help to develop eBPF tooling and author detections therein Creatively scale and operate the infrastructure and tools that handle millions of events per second Respond in our on-call rotation to fix services we run and investigate potential threats What you should have Curiosity and creativity.

Our security team supports the unwritten fourth tenet of Slack’s mission: make people’s working lives more secure. We’re serious about protecting our infrastructure, operations, and most importantly, our customers’ data. We take a systemic approach to security and strive to provide a low friction, high-impact security model across everything we do. Slack Security Engineering is hiring a curious Senior Staff level blue team software engineer to help to drive our threat detection program and to collaborate on our development efforts. An interest in development, operations, curiosity, and a deep desire to learn are key to a successful member of the team. You will work directly on the Slack Security Engineering team with a focus on threat detection, logging, and remediation. We know that no system is perfect, but we aim to provide a record of all actions taken in our environment to address any unknowns. We’d like you to have experience in some element of Data Science / ML work - the likely result here is that you start with some simple ML models for anomaly detection, and go from there. Our eventual goal is to use LLMs to advance our alerting capabilities and even train classification/clustering models specifically on our data to generate sophisticated alerts and build a feedback loop that learns on its own. The ideal candidate is passionate about finding IOCs and suggesting new features and methods of detection to the broader team of software developers. If you can imagine it, we can write the detection with you. Do you have experience with APT tradecraft and threat intel? Please come knock on our door. Many of the current members of this dozen-person team are multidisciplinary engineers; they do SecDevOps sorts of things, they write Go, they write Python, and they scale Elasticsearch to some very interesting and precarious new heights. We’re cautious AI adopters, but we are finding benefit from actively using modern AI tooling like Cursor to accelerate our efforts. This posting is to grow our US-based, widely distributed SecOps contingent which works closely with our additional Melbourne &amp; Auckland team. We’re eager to communicate and collaborate often (over Slack, of course!), and get to see each other’s faces in very regular Zoom coworking times. You’ll join the rest of the team in our on-call rotation, and we also strongly look for you to grow your engineering participation at Slack more broadly! Slack has a positive, diverse, and supportive culture—we look for people who are curious, inventive, and work to be a little better every single day. In our work together we aim to be smart, humble, hardworking, and above all, collaborative. If this sounds like a good fit for you, why not say “hello?” What you will be doing Identify and develop new features and a roadmap to augment existing tools to protect Slack’s production infrastructure and to help make our business lives simpler, more pleasant, more productive, and more secure Detect threats and help Slack be more secure Help to develop eBPF tooling and author detections therein Creatively scale and operate the infrastructure and tools that handle millions of events per second Respond in our on-call rotation to fix services we run and investigate potential threats What you should have Curiosity and creativity.

 About the job P-987 At Databricks, we are passionate about enabling data teams to solve the world's toughest problems — from making the next mode of transportation a reality to accelerating the development of medical breakthroughs. We do this by building and running the world's best data and AI infrastructure platform so our customers can use deep data insights to improve their business. Founded by engineers — and customer obsessed — we leap at every opportunity to solve technical challenges, from designing next-gen UI/UX for interfacing with data to scaling our services and infrastructure across millions of virtual machines. And we're only getting started. Modern data analysis employs sophisticated methods such as machine learning that go well beyond the roll-up and drill-down capabilities of traditional SQL query engines. As a software engineer on the Runtime team at Databricks, you will be building the next generation distributed data storage and processing systems that can outperform specialized SQL query engines in relational query performance, yet provide the expressiveness and programming abstractions to support diverse workloads ranging from ETL to data science.

Data Plane Storage : Provide reliable and high performance services and client libraries for storing and accessing humongous amount of data on cloud storage backends, e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Store. Delta Lake : A storage management system that combines the scale and cost-efficiency of data lakes, the performance and reliability of a data warehouse, and the low latency of streaming. Its higher level abstractions and guarantees, including ACID transactions and time travel, drastically simplify the complexity of real-world data engineering architecture. Delta Pipelines : It's difficult to manage even a single data engineering pipeline. The goal of the Delta Pipelines project is to make it simple and possible to orchestrate and operate tens of thousands of data pipelines. It provides a higher level abstraction for expressing data pipelines and enables customers to deploy, test &amp; upgrade pipelines and eliminate operational burdens for managing and building high quality data pipelines. Performance Engineering : Build the next generation query optimizer and execution engine that's fast, tuning free, scalable, and robust. What We Look For BS (or higher) in Computer Science, related technical field or equivalent practical experience. Comfortable working towards a multi-year vision with incremental deliverables.
